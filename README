Emacs mode for RELAX NG compact syntax
======================================

Requires rnc-mode.el by David Rosenberg, Pantor Engineering AB.

A work-in-progress for Semantic parsing of RELAX NG compact syntax
files.

Currently doesn't do any font-lock highlighting because that will
eventually be based on the Semantic parsing rather than on regular
expressions as in `rnc-mode'.
